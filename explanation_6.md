## Union Function
use of set and linkedlist for traversing each elements in both list avoiding duplicates
### Reasoning Behind Decisions:
to avoid duplicates used set
### Time Efficiency:
O(n1+n2) traversing both and insert is O(1)
### Space Efficiency:
O(n1+n2)
## Intersection Function
first list populate set1 and second pass through set2 
### Reasoning Behind Decisions:
to check each elements in both list and avoiding duplicates
### Time Efficiency:
O(n1+n2)
### Space Efficiency:
O(n1+n2)
